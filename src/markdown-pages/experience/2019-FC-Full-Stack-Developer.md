title: Flight Centre â€” Full Stack Developer

I am working in the Retail Solutions team to deliver software solutions that improve the interactions between travel consultants and retail customers. I work with a mix of modern and legacy technologies to both develop and manage several applications that are integral to Flight Centre's business across many countries. I help develop applications using cloud native architecture on AWS and as such have become familiar with many of the services available on this platform. Our modern stack allows us to build feature-rich, statically-hosted web applications using the React framework.
