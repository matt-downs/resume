During my time in this role, I worked in a small development team with a focus on React but also touching some PHP and Perl projects. I worked closely with the team's product owner to refine and deliver new features to an existing project, as well as resolve a number of existing bugs. This secondment was a very positive experience for both myself and the team I worked with - I learnt so much about collaboration, peer reviewing, best practices, and the overall agile development cycle.
