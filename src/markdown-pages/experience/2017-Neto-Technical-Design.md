At a high level, my role focuses on providing front end web development support to both clients and partner companies, specifically relating to Neto’s proprietary B@SE templating language and system configuration. I am also required to manage client expectations when it comes to new software releases, and work closely with the platform engineers and software developers to ensure that the system is working reliabily for all clients.
