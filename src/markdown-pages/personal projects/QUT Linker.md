Throughout my studies I found myself regularly wasting time searching for commonly used services on the QUT website. I created this simple Chrome extension to solve this problem by providing a customisable dropdown of helpful links to QUT services such as email and blackboard. I released it on the Chrome Web Store for a few friends to use and is now regularly used by over 300 people. Cool!
